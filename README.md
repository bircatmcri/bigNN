bigNN: an open-source sentence classifier using big data neural network architecture

Every single day, a large amount of text data is generated by different medical data sources, such as scientific literature, medical web pages, health related social media posts, clinical notes, and drug reviews. Processing this data in an efficient manner is a really daunting task without the help of clever computational strategies, and it makes text classification as an imperative and a major operation to big data text analytics. In this contribution, we developed an open-source software for big data text classification called bigNN. It implements a word2vec neural network model over Apache Spark to aim at big data sentence classification in a timely fashion. The software offers a graphical user interface, and it facilitates reproducible research in sentence analysis by allowing users to configure different sets of Apache Spark and word2vec neural network parameters. Furthermore, we introduce application of bigNN in medical informatics domain. bigNN is fully documented and it is publicly and freely available at https://github.com/bircatmcri/bigNN.

The Workflow and architectural model of the bigNN has been explained in the following work:
